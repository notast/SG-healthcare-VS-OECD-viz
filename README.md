# Background 
The current Singapore healthcare landscape is painted in a storyboard against OECD and non-OECD peers and to understand if more resources are warranted in view of a greying poupulation, tension between adequate resources versus overspending is also addressed. 

# Data
There are two datasets. The primary dataset has 1080 rows and 13 columns. The primary dataset consists of data from various sources. Variables from various sources were matched as close as possible based on available meta-data. The secondary dataset has 36 rows and 9 columns. It consists of aggerated values from the primary dataset. 

## Multiple Sources
Rudimentary, healthcare provision includes the number of beds, doctors and nurses a country has. Nonetheless, it will be myopic to operate healthcare on a unilateral plane, healthcare needs to be treated as a multi-disciplinary field for more optimal provision. Thus, additional data such as demography (e.g. the proportion elderly population `pct_Elder`) and economic status (e.g. healthcare spending expressed as share of GDP `pct_GDP` and income status of the country `Income_group`) were included. To complete the analysis, an outcome measure, life expectancy at 65 years old `years_aft65`, was used to evaluate the success of healthcare expenses. 

The multiple sources are from international (e.g. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and World Bank) and national (e.g. Government of Singapore’s data repository, data.gov.sg, and its department of statistics) organizations.
