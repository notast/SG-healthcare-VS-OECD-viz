"Public health facilities refer to those owned or controlled by a government unit or another public corporation (where control is defined as the ability to determine the general corporate policy).  Not-for-profit health facilities refer to those producing health goods and services, but are not permitted to be a source of income, profit or financial gain for the unit(s) that establish, control or finance them.  Private health facilities refer to those set up for the purpose of producing health goods and services and are capable of generating a profit or other financial gains for their owners.  Where a health facility provides more than one residential care service, the beds are counted under their respective service categories.  For example, a facility providing both community hospital and inpatient hospice services will have the respective number of beds being reported under 'Community Hospitals' and 'Inpatient Hospices'.  Beds for chronic sick services are reported under 'Nursing Homes' beds.  Prior to 2010, hospitals were licensed for built-in bed capacity.  With effect from 2010, hospitals are licensed for actual bed complement (i.e. beds that are regularly maintained and staffed)."
